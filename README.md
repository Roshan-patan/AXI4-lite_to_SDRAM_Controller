# AXI4-lite_to_SDRAM_Controller
This project focuses on designing an AXI4-Lite to SDRAM controller and verifying its functionality using the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) framework. The controller bridges an AXI4-Lite bus with SDR SDRAM, ensuring correct data storage and retrieval while adhering to SDRAM timingÂ constraints.
